This was one of, if not the first large program I've ever written. It was when I was just learning Java in high school, and I had/have 
a love for fractals.

The file is run directly via main(), and imageWidth is found by getting input from the user (a Scanner). Then it creates the fractal live.
Resizing the window will not increase the size of a small fractal - the Frame resolution is equal to image resolution. This also means that big
file (although I think I did add scroll bars) will be hard to see live, and will have to be viewed afterward.

The active pixels are set as a random colour.
